[Getting started with Speckle for Unity](https://speckle.systems/tutorials/getting-started-with-speckle-for-unity/)

## Running the demo project:
The project works on the preview desktop and I think since I have speckle installed it automatically fills the parameters for the stream connection. The gif here is 2X time so I think reaction time could be a concern for the interactions we design or at least something to discuss

## Running the project in AR

Maybe Speckle would be too hard to build natively in AR
