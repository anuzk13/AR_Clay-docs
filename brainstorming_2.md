# What platform are we gonna use?
**Wednesday next week**
- How far can we go with Fologram? should we go with it?
	- Big advantage -> 3D environment
	- Big disadvantage -> We have to kind of..hack the UI build it from 3D objects in grasshopper which might get too inefficient? 
- Connect to grasshopper ourselves
- Unity? - Cad integration of Unity 
	- Rely on python 
	- One of the biggest challenges of CAD in immersive env is because of real-time 
	- Computationally expensive?

- Do we want a good AR interaction environment?
- Do we want a good CAD solution?
- I think we have something unique in terms of the interaction
	- Piggyback on top of coil-cam
- In our interface have different forms of creation 
	- Throwing metaphor
	- This would give them mode control over the overall shape
	- Draw and extrude
- Would our project be too close to coilcam
- User study comparing different
