Joyce is checking if it's possible to build speckle for the Hololens and if it's possible to setup a local server.

Some of the staff in Speckle [replied](https://speckle.community/t/virtual-augmented-reality/4467/8) about building for the Hololens and the [code for the VR and speckle project](https://github.com/JR-Morgan/speckle-unity-vr)
